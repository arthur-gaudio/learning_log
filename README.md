# learning_log

Daily entries on what I learn while working toward:
**Data Analyst (primary)** + **Software Developer (Java secondary)** + optional **JavaScript** later.

This repo is for: notes, summaries, takeaways, and next steps.
Code + exercises live in the other repos:
- `sql` (SQL patterns + exercises)
- `powerbi` (dashboards + DAX)
- `python` (pipelines + notebooks)
- `stats` (stats notes + practice)

---

## Naming convention
Each day is one markdown file:
`YYYY-MM-DD_topic.md`

Example:
`2026-02-11_bigquery_sql_refresher.md`

---

## Daily entry format
Use `TEMPLATE.md` as a copy/paste base.

---

## How I use this repo
- Write the daily entry
- Link to the specific exercises I did in `sql/`
- Link to any Python scripts/notebooks created in `python/`
- Link to any PBIX screenshots/measures in `powerbi/`
- Write tomorrow’s plan (so momentum stays easy)
